# Potentially large directories that are not part of the deployed application logic
# Add these only if you have such directories and they are not needed by the serverless function
# For example, if you have a local 'data' folder with large datasets:
# data/
# If you have local machine learning models that are not loaded dynamically:
# models/
# If you have any frontend build artifacts:
# build/
# dist/
# node_modules/ # If you have any JavaScript dependencies for a frontend part
